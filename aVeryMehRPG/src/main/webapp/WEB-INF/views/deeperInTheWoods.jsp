As you head further into the woods you walk past a tree and find a handaxe buried in its stump. You pick up the handaxe and make it your special weapon. 
As you continue on you're journey your confronted by a giant spider and realize that peace may not be in his nature.
The spider looks at you and exclaims “Hey bro, quick question… where are your shoes?"
<br>
<br>
Do you:
<br>
<br>
 1.Respond with a snarky comment “Wouldn’t you like to know Spider-boy?"
 <br>
 2.Take off your sock and chuck it at the Spider to try and scare if off
