<h1 id="woods">Later, in the Woods. . .</h1>
<h2>${player}</h2>

<p id ="storyspan"> 

You wake up several hours later in the middle of the woods and realize that your brand-new collectable Batman shoes have been taken
and youâ€™ve lost 5 points of health.

<br>
<br>
Do you:
<br>
<br>
 1. Craft a makeshift pair of shoes out of leaves and walk back towards civilization
 <br>
 2. Go deeper into the woods and accept the fact that no one will believe a stranger took your shoes, so this is now your home.
